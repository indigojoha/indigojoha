Iâ€™m Johanna, or indigoJoha/indigoUan online. I live in Italy and I'm 19 years old.  
I've been coding with Haxe for roughly four or five years, and I'm currently learning C# and .NET.  
I attend a Health and Society highschool (Sociosanitario). I'm neither healthy nor social, but I'll take what I can.
